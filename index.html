                    The Tahigami Music Box D1-40 is a portable generative synthesizer that turns geometry into music. 
                    Using algorithms based on graph theory and geometric "blossoms," the device synthesizes unique soundscapes 
                    in real-time, generating new combinations of tonality, timbre, rhythm, and texture.

                <p class="large-text">
                    The result is an endless, evolving stream of music designed for meditation, focus, and rest.

                        <h3>The Origin: From Toxic Workspaces to "Aural Melatonin"</h3>
                        <p>
                            The D1-40 was born on <strong>July 10, 2020</strong>, during the COVID-19 pandemic. It originated from a personal 
                            request by Donna, Datu's wife, (then a lawyer, now a trial judge) who desired a portable instrument to soothe her 
                            mind during high-stress work weeks.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            While initially intended for relaxation and sleep, Datu and Donna soon discovered the D1-40 was equally essential 
                            for focus and concentration. Since its inception, it has served as a companion for meditation, a sleeping aid for 
                            families, and a tool to find stillness amidst everyday chaos like traffic or the stagnant monotony of idle waiting.
                        </p>
                        <h4>The Philosophy of Tahigami</h4>
                        <p>
                            The device is a digital manifestation of <strong>Tahigami</strong>, a rule-based art form developed by artist 
                            <strong>Datu Arellano</strong>. The name is derived from the Filipino word <em>tahi</em> (stitch) and the Japanese 
                            <em>gami</em> (paper)—literally <strong>"stitching on paper"</strong>. Tahigami employs concepts from <strong>geometry 
                            and graph theory</strong>, utilizing the triangle as its basic building block. In this system, points are called 
                            <strong>punctures</strong>, lines are <strong>threads</strong>, and triangles are <strong>seeds</strong>. When these 
                            elements form an abstract image, it is called a <strong>blossom</strong>.
                        </p>

                        <h3>How it Works: The Generative Engine</h3>
                        <p>
                            Unlike traditional music players, the D1-40 contains <strong>no pre-recorded samples</strong>. It is a 
                            <strong>generative synthesizer</strong> that creates music in real-time based on the following logic:
                        </p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Blossoms as Maps:</strong> The device treats four specific geometric patterns—<strong>Bundok</strong> 
                                (Mountain), <strong>Alon</strong> (Wave), <strong>Bituin</strong> (Radial), and <strong>Dahon</strong> (Leaf)—as 
                                musical maps. Every puncture in a blossom is then mapped to a specific musical note that is quantized to a musical scale.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Algorithmic "Walks":</strong> To create a melody, the device "walks" through the map by following different 
                                paths, such as the <strong>contour</strong> (the outer edge) or the <strong>skeleton</strong> (the internal structure).
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Dynamic Parameters:</strong> Every composition is unique because the device randomly selects the 
                                <strong>tempo, key, scale, timbre, and rhythm</strong>. It draws from <strong>nine musical scales</strong> 
                                (such as Lydian, Prometheus, and Major Pentatonic) chosen specifically for their ability to induce relaxation.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Complex Soundscapes:</strong> The engine synthesizes a lead voice (the Blossom), a low bass accompaniment, 
                                and two harmonic voices, often accompanied by synthesized environmental sounds like ocean-like white noise, birds, 
                                radio static, or light percussive beats and rumbles.
                            </li>
                        </ol>

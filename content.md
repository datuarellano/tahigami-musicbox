# Description

The Tahigami Music Box D1-40 is a portable generative synthesizer that turns geometry into music. Using algorithms based on graph theory and geometric "blossoms," the device synthesizes unique soundscapes in real-time, generating new combinations of tonality, timbre, rhythm, and texture. The result is an endless, evolving stream of music designed for meditation, focus, and rest.

Hand-built by Filipino artist Datu Arellano in Quezon City, Philippines

2nd Edition is now available for pre-order

Description: The **Tahigami Music Box Sampler** is a sonic exhibition of the infinite, ever-evolving soundscapes generated by the **D1-40 portable generative synthesizer**. This collection features 16 recordings (at 3 minutes and 12 seconds each), capturing four unique regenerations for each of the four geometric blossoms: **Bundok** (Mountain), **Alon** (Wave), **Bituin** (Radial), and **Dahon** (Leaf). Every note and texture heard here was synthesized in real-time by the device’s internal algorithms—based on graph theory and the rule-based art of **Tahigami**—with absolutely no pre-recorded samples. Originally conceived as "aural melatonin" to soothe the mind in high-stress environments, this sampler offers a glimpse into the "generative tranquility" the D1-40 provides for meditation, focus, and rest.

## Tab: Origin
**The Origin: From Toxic Workspaces to "Aural Melatonin"**

The D1-40 was born on **July 10, 2020**, during the COVID-19 pandemic. It originated from a personal request by Donna, Datu's wife, (then a lawyer, now a trial judge) who desired a portable instrument to soothe her mind during high-stress work weeks.

While initially intended for relaxation and sleep, Datu and Donna soon discovered the D1-40 was equally essential for focus and concentration. Since its inception, it has served as a companion for meditation, a sleeping aid for families, and a tool to find stillness amidst everyday chaos like traffic or the stagnant monotony of idle waiting.

**The Philosophy of Tahigami**

The device is a digital manifestation of **Tahigami**, a rule-based art form developed by artist **Datu Arellano**. The name is derived from the Filipino word _tahi_ (stitch) and the Japanese _gami_ (paper)—literally **"stitching on paper"**. Tahigami employs concepts from **geometry and graph theory**, utilizing the triangle as its basic building block. In this system, points are called **punctures**, lines are **threads**, and triangles are **seeds**. When these elements form an abstract image, it is called a **blossom**.

## Tab: How it Works
**How it Works: The Generative Engine**

Unlike traditional music players, the D1-40 contains **no pre-recorded samples**. It is a **generative synthesizer** that creates music in real-time based on the following logic:

1. **Blossoms as Maps:** The device treats four specific geometric patterns—**Bundok** (Mountain), **Alon** (Wave), **Bituin** (Radial), and **Dahon** (Leaf)—as musical maps. Every puncture in a blossom is then mapped to a specific musical note that is quantized to a musical scale.

2. **Algorithmic "Walks":** To create a melody, the device "walks" through the map by following different paths, such as the **contour** (the outer edge) or the **skeleton** (the internal structure).

3. **Dynamic Parameters:** Every composition is unique because the device randomly selects the **tempo, key, scale, timbre, and rhythm**. It draws from **nine musical scales** (such as Lydian, Prometheus, and Major Pentatonic) chosen specifically for their ability to induce relaxation.

4. **Complex Soundscapes:** The engine synthesizes a lead voice (the Blossom), a low bass accompaniment, and two harmonic voices, often accompanied by synthesized environmental sounds like ocean-like white noise, birds, radio static, or light percussive beats and rumbles.

## Tab: Specs
**Technical Specifications**

The D1-40 is hand-built with high-performance components designed for dedicated audio synthesis:

• **Brain:** Teensy 4.0 microcontroller board (by PJRC).

• **Audio:** Teensy Audio Adapter Board

• **Power:** 2500 mAh lithium-ion polymer battery, managed by a TC4056A charging module.

• **Enclosure:** The 2nd Edition (2026) features a tough, 3D-printed enclosure made of **carbon fiber-reinforced plastic (PLA-CF)**.

• **Interaction:** Includes a **light sensor** that allows users to change the "intensity" or quality of the music by altering the light in their surroundings.

**Operational Rituals**

• **The 40-Minute Cycle:** If left alone, the device automatically regenerates a new composition every 40 minutes. This makes it an **unconventional ritual timer** for work or study sessions.

• **Breathing Room:** Upon powering up, the LED flashes white for a few seconds to remind the user to **slow down and take deep breaths**.

• **Visual Feedback:** The LED color identifies the current blossom: **Red** (Bundok), **Blue** (Alon), **Yellow** (Bituin), and **Green** (Dahon).

**Maintenance and Care**

To ensure the longevity of the D1-40, users should follow these guidelines:

• **Charging:** Always turn the device **OFF** while charging.

• **Environment:** The device is **not water-resistant** and must be kept away from extreme heat and direct sunlight.

• **Handling:** Avoid dropping the device.
